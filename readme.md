# Acme Widget Co Lab Code Test



## Intro


This PHP project serves as a proof of concept for Acme Widget Coâ€™s new sales system. Acme Widget Co is a leading provider of fictional widgets.


## Assumptions


1. I assumed that when the user adds more than one red widget (R01) to the cart, and the offer 'buy one red widget, get the second half price' is applied, the discount will be applied as follows:

- For every pair of red widgets (R01) in the cart, the first red widget is charged at full price, and the second red widget is charged at half price.

This project requires the following:

- **PHP**: >= 8.0  
  (Some dependencies such as `monolog/monolog` require PHP 8 or higher.)
